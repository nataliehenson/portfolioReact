                            I am a dedicated new developer who enjoys building
                            responsive web. Throughout the past eight years, I
                            have grown my ability to design, create, gather
                            feedback and data, and tweak life-changing youth
                            development programs, events, and leadership
                            cohorts. These years in nonprofit have taught me
                            flexibility, collaboration, and dedication.

                            After completing a Full Stack Web and Mobile
                            Development Bootcamp, I want to continue to learn
                            more while working on teams with guidance and
                            mentorship to create the most effective, efficient
                            code. I am passionate about learning new methods,
                            solving puzzles, and creating solutions for complex
                            problems to make information more accessible and
                            useful. I'm available for remote part-time or
                            freelance work.
